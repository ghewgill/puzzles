 * Grid structures:
 * A grid is made up of faces, edges and dots.  These structures hold
 * the incidence relationships between these types.  For example, an
 * edge always joins two dots, and is adjacent to two faces.
 * The "grid_xxx **" members are lists of pointers which are dynamically
 * allocated during grid generation.
 * A pointer to a face/edge/dot will always point somewhere inside one of the
 * three lists of the main "grid" structure: faces, edges, dots.
 * Could have used integer offsets into these lists, but using actual
 * pointers instead gives us type-safety.

   * computed, because it's fiddly to do. You can call
