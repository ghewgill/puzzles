# Spokes

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/x-sheep/puzzles-unreleased/master/docs/img/spokes.png)

You are given a grid filled with hubs with numbers on them. Your objective is to draw lines between them while following these rules:

1. You can only draw a line starting from a hub's point. If there is no point visible, you cannot draw a line.
2. Only one line can be drawn between two hubs.
3. The number indicates the amount of lines starting from a hub.
4. Lines cannot cross each other.
5. All hubs must form a single connected group.

The inventor of this puzzle type is unknown.

## Controls

To draw a line, left-click and drag from one hub to another. You can mark a dot as unused by dragging between hubs with the right mouse button.

You can also use the keyboard. Use the arrow keys to move the cursor on top of a dot, then press Enter to draw a line or Space to mark it.

## Spokes parameters

These parameters are available from the ‘Custom…’ option on the ‘Type’ menu.

<dl>
	<dt>Width, Height</dt>
	<dd>Size of the grid in squares.</dd>

## Status

This game is playable.

In my opinion, the gap between Easy and Tricky difficulty is currently too high, and there should be more difficulty levels between the two.

It would also be interesting if the game had more varied layouts similar to [Puzzle Picnic](http://www.puzzlepicnic.com/genre?id=12), where the grids aren't fully filled with hubs.
