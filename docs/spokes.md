# Spokes

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/x-sheep/puzzles-unreleased/master/docs/img/spokes.png)

You are given a grid filled with hubs with numbers on them. Your objective is to draw lines between them while following these rules:

1. You can only draw a line starting from a hub's point. If there is no point visible, you cannot draw a line.
2. Only one line can be drawn between two hubs.
3. The number indicates the amount of lines starting from a hub.
4. Lines cannot cross each other.
5. All hubs must form a single connected group.

The inventor of this puzzle type is unknown.

## Controls

To draw a line, left-click and drag from one hub to another. You can mark a dot as unused by dragging between hubs with the right mouse button.

You can also use the keyboard. Use the arrow keys to move the cursor on top of a dot, then press Enter to draw a line or Space to mark it.

## Spokes parameters

These parameters are available from the ‘Custom…’ option on the ‘Type’ menu.

## Status

This game is playable.

It would be interesting if the game had more varied layouts similar to [Puzzle Picnic](http://www.puzzlepicnic.com/genre?id=12), where the grids aren't fully filled with hubs.
