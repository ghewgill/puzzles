# Sticks

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/x-sheep/puzzles-unreleased/master/docs/img/sticks.png)

You are given a grid with several black cells. Fill every blank cell with a line, which connects two cell edges and goes horizontally or vertically through the center of the cell. The lines must follow these rules:

1. A number overlapping a line indicates the length of that line.
2. A line can't overlap more than one number.
3. Numbers in black cells indicate the amount of lines connected to the cell.
