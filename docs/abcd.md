# ABCD

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/x-sheep/puzzles-unreleased/master/docs/img/abcd.png)

You're given an empty grid, and several rows of numbers on the side. You have to write a letter in every empty cell, following these rules:

1. The numbers on the edge indicate how many instances of a specific letter appear in that row or column.
2. Identical letters can not be horizontally or vertically adjacent.

The inventor of this type is unknown. This puzzle is also known under the names *ABCD Puzzle*, *ABC-Kombi* or *ABCD-Rätsel*.

## Controls

ABCD uses the same control scheme as Solo, but with letters instead of numbers.

Left-click to select a cell, then type a letter on your keyboard to enter it. Press Backspace or Space to clear a cell.

Right-click a cell, then type a letter to add a pencil mark. Pencil marks can be used for any purpose.

You can also use the arrow keys to move the selected cell around. Press Enter to toggle between entering letters and entering pencil marks.

Press the 'M' key to fill every empty cell with all possible pencil marks.
