You're given a grid, with several dots inside colored squares. Your objective is to fill every empty space with one of two colors while following these rules:

1. Tiles which are adjacent to 1 other tile of the same color are denoted with a dot. All of these tiles are given.
2. All other tiles must be adjacent to 2 or more tiles of the same color.
