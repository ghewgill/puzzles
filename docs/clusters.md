![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/x-sheep/puzzles-unreleased/master/docs/img/clusters.png)

You're given a grid, with several dots inside colored squares. Your objective is to fill every empty space with one of two colors while following these rules:

1. Tiles which are adjacent to 1 other tile of the same color are denoted with a dot. All of these tiles are given.
2. All other tiles must be adjacent to 2 or more tiles of the same color.

This puzzle type was invented by Inaba Naoki under the name *クラスター*, or literally *Kurasuta*, which Google Translate names 'Cluster'. The original puzzles are available here: http://www.inabapuzzle.com/honkaku/kura.html
