# Rome

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/x-sheep/puzzles-unreleased/master/docs/img/rome.png)

You're given a grid that has been divided into areas, containing arrows and one or more goals (represented by circles). Your goal is to fill every empty space with an arrow pointing up, down, left or right while following these rules:

1. Every outlined area contains different arrows.
2. Following the arrows must lead to one of the circled goals.

This type was invented by [Nikoli](https://www.nikoli.co.jp/), who name it *Roma*.

## Controls

Click and hold a square, then drag in one of the four directions to place an arrow.

Right-click and drag to place a pencil mark. Pencil marks can be used for any purpose.

The keyboard can also be used. Move the cursor with the arrow keys, and press Enter followed with an arrow key to place an arrow. Use Space to add pencil marks. Alternatively, use the arrows on the numpad to enter arrows directly.
