Objective of the game: Shade several cells in the hexagonal grid 
while following these rules:
1. Each shaded cell must have at least one shaded cell below it
   (unless it's on the bottom row).
2. There can not be 3 or more shaded cells in a horizontal row.
3. A number indicates the amount of shaded cells around it.
4. Cells with numbers cannot be shaded.

This genre was invented by Nikoli.
