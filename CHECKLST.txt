Things to remember when adding a new puzzle
-------------------------------------------

Write the source file for the new puzzle (duhh).

Create a .R file for it which:
 - defines a <puzzle>_EXTRA symbol for it if it requires auxiliary
   object files (make sure that symbol doesn't contain the icon)
 - adds it to the `ALL' definition, to ensure it is compiled into
   the OS X binary
 - adds it as a GTK build target, with the optional GTK icon
 - adds it as a Windows build target, with the optional resource
   file
 - adds auxiliary solver binaries if any
 - adds it to $(GAMES) in both the automake and GTK makefiles, for
   `make install'
 - adds it to list.c for the OS X binary
 - adds it to gamedesc.txt, with its Windows executable name, display
   name, and slightly longer description.

If the puzzle is by a new author, modify the copyright notice in
LICENCE and in puzzles.but. (Also in index.html, but that's listed
below under website changes.)

Double-check that the game structure name in the source file has
been renamed from `nullgame', so that it'll work on OS X. Actually
compiling it on OS X would be a good way to check this, if
convenient.

Add a documentation section in puzzles.but.

Make sure there's a Windows help topic name defined in puzzles.but,
and that it's referenced by the help topic field in the game
structure in the source file.

Check that REQUIRE_RBUTTON and/or REQUIRE_NUMPAD are set as
appropriate.

Add the new Unix binary name, and the names of any auxiliary solver
binaries, to .gitignore.

Write an instructions fragment for the webified puzzle pages, as
html/<puzzlename>.html .

Make a screenshot:
 - create an appropriate save file in `icons'
 - add the puzzle name to icons/Makefile
 - set up a REDO property in icons/Makefile if the screenshot wants
   to display a move halfway through an animation
 - set up a CROP property in icons/Makefile if the icon wants to be
   a sub-rectangle of the whole screenshot

Don't forget to `git add' the new source file, the new .R file and the
save file in `icons', the new .html file, and any other new files that
might have been involved.

Check in!

Put the puzzle on the web:
 - run puzzlesnap.sh
 - adjust the copyright in index-mid.html if the puzzle is by a new
   author
 - check that the new puzzle has appeared on the staging web page
 - test both Windows binary links, the docs link, the Javascript
   version and the Java version
 - run webupdate
 - test all those things once more on the live website
