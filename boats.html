<h1><a name="C45"></a>Chapter 45: <a name="i0"></a>Boats</h1>
<p>
You're given a grid, and a list of boats which must be located inside that grid. Boats can be rotated. Two boats cannot be horizontally, vertically or diagonally adjacent.
</p>
<p>
The numbers on the side indicate the amount of cells inside that row or column which are occupied by a boat.
</p>
<p>
Some boat segments are given (corner pieces, centers, or single-length boats), along with their orientation.
</p>
<p>
At the bottom of the puzzle is a list of every boat that must be placed in the grid. When a boat is found, it is automatically crossed off of this list. Make sure a boat is surrounded by water on all sides, to indicate that it cannot possibly grow any further.
</p>
<p>
This puzzle is best known as <em>Battleships</em>.
