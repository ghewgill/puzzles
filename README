This is the README accompanying the source code to Simon Tatham's
puzzle collection. The collection's web site is at
<https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/puzzles/>.

The puzzle collection is built using CMake <https://cmake.org/>. To
compile in the simplest way (on any of Linux, Windows or Mac), run
these commands in the source directory:

  cmake .
  cmake --build .

The manual is provided in Windows Help format for the Windows build;
in text format for anyone who needs it; and in HTML for the Mac OS X
application and for the web site. It is generated from a Halibut
source file (puzzles.but), which is the preferred form for
modification. To generate the manual in other formats, rebuild it,
or learn about Halibut, visit the Halibut website at
<https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/halibut/>.
