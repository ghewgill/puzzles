Undead
<p>
Fill in every grid square which doesn't contain a mirror with either a
ghost, a vampire, or a zombie. The numbers round the grid edges show
how many monsters must be visible along your line of sight if you look
directly into the grid from that position, along a row or column.
Zombies are always visible; ghosts are only visible when reflected in
at least one mirror; vampires are only visible when not reflected in
any mirror.

<p>
To place a monster, click in a square to select it, then type the
monster's letter on the keyboard: G for a ghost, V for a vampire or Z
for a zombie. To erase a monster, click to select a square and then
press Backspace.
<p>
Right-click in a square and then type a letter to add or remove the
monster as a pencil mark, indicating monsters that you think
<em>might</em> go in that square.
<p>
Left-click on a clue to mark it as done (grey it out). To unmark a
clue as done, left-click on it again.
